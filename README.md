# User Story

As a user, I want to click the button reading "click to become a sunflower parent" to start the game.

As a user, I want to name my sunflower by typing in the input box. This will move to the main page.


As a user, clicking the sunlight button will decrease sleepiness.

As a user, clicking the water button will decrease hunger.

As a user, clicking the affirmation button will decrease bordem.

As a user, I want to see the amount of each metric scale easily on the screen using a bar.

The goal is to keep the sunflower alive by keeping all levels below 10.

The plant will grow when age hits 3. Day increases by 1 every 15 seconds;

If the sunflower wilts, the user will have the ability to click and start a new game. 



# If I could go back with more time:

AAU, clicking the sunlight button will show a sun image over the flower.

AAU, clicking the water button will show a watering can image over the flower.

AAU, clicking the affirmation button will show a heart image over the flower.


I had the idea to include a counter of how many of each metric is clicked, but never figured out how to make it work. I kept the code in my project so when I can, I can go back and play around with it.
